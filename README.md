Conversion script has no dependancies outside of ciphertext input: converts to binary (utf-8), replaces 1>i & 0>o and then separates each byte with a random string of lowercase letters. The length of this string is between 1 and 10 characters and is decided randomly.
pageindent.py has some prerequisites outlined in datescript.py which is to be implemented locally by SCS client.
